# About Me

## Websites I Recommend
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - For me, videos are the best way to be introduced to a topic, and YouTube has both entertainment and educational videos available.
* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com) - Amazon is a great place to search for items you may need or want, and ships to most places.
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) - While the information on this site is not always the most accurate, I have found many technology troubleshooting solutions from people with similar problems. Always search up what you are attempting to do before following through.
